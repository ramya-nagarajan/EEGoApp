This is an Android application which is based on the idea of guided meditation. The application makes a Bluetooth connection between a mobile device
and an EEG headset. This headset is capable of sending brain waves and can read the values of alpha, beta, gamma and theta waves at any point in time.
The user wears the headband and starts meditating. The initial phase consists of gaining readings based on a 30s-1min meditation. The next phase
involves the actual meditation for a certain duration chosen by the user(like 3 minutes or 5 minutes). At the end of each session they are provided
with feedback about how many minutes their mind was in its most calm or tranquil state.

The UI is very user friendly and interactive and has been designed and developed from scratch. The product was developed over multiple iterations and received much appreciation
for its user inteface.

The application can be run on an Android device of choice by installing the package(APK file) using a USB cable and in debugging mode.
